The "Practical intro to KMM" is a short guide that covers the essential information you need to know to create a Kotlin Multiplatform app. 
It includes information on the unique features and functions of KMM, the methodology for cross-platform development, and helpful libraries. 
This resource provides a practical introduction to KMM, helping you get started with creating your own app.
